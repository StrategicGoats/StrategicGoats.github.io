					<h1>The final release of Peril</h1>
					<p>We spent this week fixing bugs which was found from
						gathering feedback. There was a bug in the point economy, and some
						colours within the minimap was incorrect. We then spent this final
						week discussing the final presentation.</p>
					<p>Now that the beta has conculded we are adjusting some of the
						point prices and reqards for in game actions.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Upgrading Units: 3 points -> 4 points</li>
						<li>Blocking link: 4 points -> 10 points</li>
						<li>Conquering a country: 3 points -> 2 points</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We hope these changes will imporve the game play balance.</p>
					<p>See you next week for the final blog post</p>

					<h1>The AI Tournament Results</h1>
					<p>Good afternoon! The AI tournament is at an end and our last
						touches are being made for the final release of Peril on the 19th
						of march!</p>
					<h2>The rules</h2>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>Each bracket match will be best of three to account for
							random chance.
							<ol type="a">
								<li>For the first game in the match Player 1 will be the
									decided by coin toss.</li>
								<li>Then for the second game Player 1 will be given to the
									opposition.</li>
								<li>If there is a third game, Player 1 will be decided by
									coin toss again.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>

						<li>AI should be stable.
							<ol type="a">
								<li>If an AI causes an exception then that AI will forfeit
									that game not the match.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Stale mates will be resolved by coin toss.
							<ul>
								<li>A stalemate is defined by the two AI players that
									repeatedly attack and capture the same countries infinity.</li>
								<li>No game should last longer than 30 minutes. If this
									happened the AI with the highest total points [current points +
									points spent] will win.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>The podium defines the winner of the game. Points don’t
							matter when the game finishes.</li>
						<li>For all games each player starts with ONE country, Player
							1 starts with Alaska, Player 2 starts with Kamchatka</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We kept to these rules and we genterated these brackets.</p>
					<img src="images/brackets.png" style="width: 100%;" />
					<h2>The results</h2>
					<p>Duckling and Goat disqualified as they were not functional
						and therefore could not compete.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Knight beat Ernie 2-0</li>
						<li>Noob beat Ocelot 2-0</li>
						<li>Knight beat Noob 2-0</li>
						<li>Knight beat Final Boss 2-1</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The tournament has exposed a bug in the environmental
						haazrds causing powerful units to be given when they were not
						purchased. Knight won because of this however a win is a win.</p>
					<p>Gurdeep is the best AI develoepr!</p>
					<h2>Upcoming updates</h2>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>New, detailed instructions written in full to help
							players which are new to Peril.</li>
						<li>Easy, Medium and Hard AI’s</li>
						<li>Improved credits page for better readability</li>
						<li>A fancy pre-game load screen splash displaying ‘Strategic
							Goats</li>
						<li>A new, better looking map</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>The beta</h2>
					<p>The beta will start later today and we hope that you guys
						will all give our game a shot. A feedback questionaire is bundled
						with the game and should be used to submit and issues or feedback
						to us.</p>
					<p>Hope everyone is looking forward to the final release of
						Peril on 19/03/18 as much as we are. Remember to update your
						version of Peril to get a grip of the new updates!</p>

					<h1>The state of Peril</h1>
					<p>Hello everyone</p>
					<p>Project Lead (Joshua) here to talk about where Peril is in
						terms of final release and the open beta.</p>
					<p>Usually, James from WDMRT collects all the information from
						the separate groups to curates this post but today we felt that
						the information would be best coming from the head honcho.</p>
					<p>We are working diligently to prepare the game for final
						release and our development team (myself included) are adding fun
						new features that we hope will provide complexity and new
						strategic avenues for players.</p>
					<p>Our design/gameplay balance philosophy is “the smarter
						player should win”. However, we still want the game to be
						interesting to play even when there is an experience disparity.</p>
					<p>We have introduced a point based economy:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Points can be spent on upgrading countries and units.</li>
						<li>Points are rewarded for killing units, taking countries
							and completing challenges.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The beta test will begin 01/03/18 and last for two weeks.
						During this period players will be able to download the beta
						version of Peril and submit feedback via a link packaged with the
						game.</p>
					<p>We hope that their feedback will be in depth and give us
						meaningful insight into the small tweaks to be made for the final
						release.</p>
					<p>Our final release of the game is slated for 19/03/18.</p>
					<p>
						See you then<br> Joshua

					<h1>Determining the metagame</h1>
					<p>Good evening, Peril is getting closer and closer to release
						and we are as excited as you are.</p>
					<h2>AI tournament update</h2>
					<p>The entire team is working on their AIs however they are not
						ready for a fight yet. The tournament has been postponed for two
						weeks. We have also been making refinements to the unit system and
						our current test build has shown that units will play a really
						large part of the metagame.</p>


					<h2>Newest Additions</h2>

					<ol>
						<li>Mini-Map<br>A useful, visual aid to help players
							locate their enemies! This will be a simplified view of the
							entire map to make the game more user friendly
						</li>
						<li>UI Improvements<br>The user interface is being
							finalised. Some tweaks and bug fixes have been made! Unscaled
							images are now in the process of being fixed and we will try and
							accommodate screen resolutions of 2k and above in future updates.
							We have recieved feedback from UI surveys and we will implement
							the changes you have requested, keep in touch for when these
							changes drop!
						</li>
						<li>AI<br> The group members’ implementation for the AI
							tournament should be in its final stages tomorrow, meaning the
							best and most complex AI will win a prize next Thursday! Pro
							Peril players will now be tested on their skill to beat this new,
							challenging AI bot, along with a variety of other AI’s at various
							difficulty levels.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>In addition to this, we have been playing around with the
						idea of allowing countries to block links between them and an
						enemy country for a certain number of points. We are looking at
						how this will affect the game as a whole but this feature is still
						in its infancy.</p>

					<p>More on this next week.</p>

					<h1>Downsizing</h1>
					<p>Everyone has had their own AI setup however they are not
						fully complete. This week we just focused on implementing the new
						features.</p>
					<p>More menus have now been implemented and the credits page is
						looking good with all members of the group featured on it. The
						menu now shows Player details, Country Upgrade, Consumables shop.</p>
					<p>We have added a mini map after feedback which stated that
						the map was too big to just pan over. So that now displays at the
						top right corner and shows the user the entire map but in small.
						We haven’t got the country colours displaying at the moment, but
						it is definitely on the list.</p>
					<p>Mohammad and Nikita have left the team and we are
						redistributing their workload as equally as possible, but the
						final release of the game will be affected.</p>
					<p>See you guys next week.</p>

					<h1>An AI tournament?</h1>
					<p>We decided to add was to be able to have vs the AI. Everyone
						was to create their own AI, using an AI API and the winner AI will
						be used as the hardest difficulty AI. We also get to see who can
						create the best and most complex AI.</p>
					<p>Also discussed new implementations that can be added to the
						game to improve upon such as goat logo on startup menu to take us
						to the website, new startup screen to select AI player(s) and a
						number of real players.</p>
					<p>The Quality Assurance Report has also been planned out and
						started to write up.</p>
					<p>Last week we mentioned a point based system. With points can
						buy consumables aka weapons, defence line to prevent a country
						attacking from one side - disable links between countries. Drop
						units in the middle of enemy territory, move units between
						isolated places. New maps, new challenges and Unit types - a tank
						can roll 4-6, troops roll 1-6, increase the chance of rolling
						higher numbers when more powerful.</p>
					<p>This is still just a concept but we would love some
						feedback.</p>
					<p>See you guys next week.</p>

					<h1>The birth of AI</h1>
					<p>Hi, Project lead Josh here to talk about the future of
						Peril.</p>

					<p>Our game has seen some serious back end improvements to the
						game architecture which has allowed us to add AI to the game.</p>

					<p>"Hold on" I hear you ask, "when did this happen?"</p>

					<p>During the break we had a large code refactor headed by
						yours truely. This needed to be conducted during a period when
						there was no development occuring so it would not effect any
						features currently in development.</p>

					<p>Never the less, the game was left in a much better state and
						shortly after the first itteration of AI was added. Codename
						'Monkey' based on its low inteligence.</p>

					<p>AI aside, here is a list of some of the features we are
						thinking of adding for the final release:</p>

					<ol type="1">
						<li>Allow for greater screen resolutions by creating 2K map
							images.</li>
						<li>UI improvements
							<ol type="a">
								<li>Better help menu</li>
								<li>Tutorial mode</li>
								<li>Scroll bars</li>
								<li>Tool tips</li>
								<li>Real time player specific statistics</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Upgrading countries to have defenses</li>
						<li>Units with a variety of strength</li>
						<li>Points</li>
						<li>Credits</li>
						<li>AI improvements

								<li>Difficulty settings</li>

					<h1>The MVP for Peril, what features does it have?</h1>
					<p>Horray! The MVP demo went off with out any issuse. While
						some of the questions asked in the Q and A where abit suspect the
						audience seemed very interested with our game and what we had
						managed to achieve in such a short development period.</p>
					<p>We have a functional game which perfectly portrays how it
						should work! Peril's current features are:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>Finely tuned setup menu allowing you to distribute your
							armies in equal quantities either randomly or specifically placed
							on the board.</li>
						<li>Working reinforcement state allowing players to
							distribute units according to the round number and the players’
							owned countries.</li>
						<li>Challenges that the user can work towards completing.</li>
						<li>Saving game states in multiple save slots which can be
							loaded from the main menu.</li>
						<li>A music toggle</li>
						<li>Working combat phase allowing players to attack other
							players’ countries. Higher the army size of the attacker, results
							in a higher chance of a successful invasion. Each unit represents
							a dice roll which ultimately means using more units results in a
							higher value dice roll.</li>
						<li>New help menu, explaining the rules of the game itself
							and the application denoted by a ‘?’ symbol.</li>
						<li>An operative movement state, allowing the user to
							transfer units from one country to another. Troops can be moved
							between non-neighbouring countries if there is a chain,
							connecting friendly countries. This can be seen by a path finding
							feature also implemented into the game.</li>
						<li>An good looking victory screen showing the rankings of
							players in order of when they were knocked out of the game.</li>
						<li>Environmental hazards which could occur randomly after
							each state, possibly reducing army sizes depending on the hazard.</li>
						<li>An impressive new map representing ‘Tamriel’ from the
							popular video game ‘The Elder Scrolls’.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Now that we have completed the MVP we will be taking a break
						from development to focus on our upcoming exams. The strategic
						goats will continue work in the new year (22/01/18).</p>
					<p>Happy domination!</p>

					<h1>Meeting the critic</h1>
					<p>We're back! It’s the final countdown to the MVP and we have
						been practising like crazy! We have been anticipating some
						questions that may be asked at the end of the presentation, so
						each one of us has been quizzed on the ins and outs of the game,
						to ensure we are prepared.</p>
					<p>We had our meeting with the critic, and the feedback we
						received was very positive, the only points the critic mentioned
						was that the UI needed to include more indicators of which player
						is which.</p>
					<p>Now that the MVP demo is right around the corner we have
						taken the step to proofread all the menus and any other text
						objects in the game, as well as test the game using JUnit testing.</p>
					<p>The game now has a new map inspired by Elder Scrolls called
						Tamriel, a fully implemented victory screen and the dice rolls are
						displayed in the combat phase. Our next post from us will be after
						the MVP detailing what exactly we have added to the game. Thanks
						for reading guys, and stay tuned for more.</p>

					<h1>Rehearse, Rehearse, Rehearse</h1>
					<p>As the MVP demo looms over our heads we have been meeting
						twice a week to practice the demo. We have scripted every event
						down to the mouse clicks that will accompant our speech. We hope
						that nothing goes wrong on the day!</p>
					<p>As far as developement goes we have added:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A combat memnu that shows the armies engaged in the war.</li>
						<li>The end screen posium that displays the order that
							players were knocked out.</li>
						<li>The ability to select which map you want to play.</li>
						<li>Game saving and loading.</li>
						<li>A path finding algorithm that lets you move units across
							long chains of friendly countries instantly.</li>
						<li>And more which we will show off at the demo....</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We will talk more about our progress soon because some
						features are not tested fully yet. See you guys next week.</p>

					<h1>Scripting greatness</h1>
					<p>Hello guys! Not much has gone on this week in terms of new
						development, however we are continuing to work on the points
						detailed in the previous blog post, in order to perfect and smash
						the MVP presentation. The UI is being refined, by including button
						icons which are universally understood, such as; a ‘?’ for help
						and an ‘X’ for exit from a menu etc.</p>
					<p>We have finalised our plan for the MVP presentation and we
						have been writing our individual scripts, ensuring to not go over
						the time limit allocated to each member. As well as writing our
						scripts, we have been rehearsing the presentation alongside the
						game being played, so we can give a live demo as we talk about the
						game. Every member of the group has been given a specific topic to
						talk about and when as well.</p>
					<p>After this week we are looking at having a code freeze, in
						order to finalize changes and minimise errors in the game. From
						here we are looking at scheduling a meeting with the critic to get
						an idea of how well the game is designed from an outsider's
						perspective.</p>

					<h1>Planning the MVP demo</h1>
					<p>This week we have been planning our demonstration for the
						MVP, it’s quite a hectic task showing all the key elements of a
						2-hour game in just 5 minutes. However, through some great
						planning headed by Nikita, we hope to produce a great demo.</p>
					<p>As far as additions we have made so far to the MVP we have
						music and a basic game menus. We are still thinking of ideas to
						add to the MVP such as an AI and a splash screen whilst the game
						is loading. In terms of progress to the MVP, the IDT will be
						creating the backed logic for the new game state menus and
						visualising the environmental hazards.</p>
					<p>The UIDT will be refining the UI making it nicer to look at,
						and working on a more concrete plan for the MVP. The WDMRT will
						continue doing what they do best, writing up the deliverables and
						keeping you guys updated each week!</p>

					<h1>Bye bye hack</h1>
					<p>We are back after submitting our Hack! This week we have
						been reflecting on how well we all worked together during the hack
						submission. We have taken our strengths and weaknesses into
						account and figured out what we want to achieve for future
						submissions.</p>
					<p>Some members have been moved between sub-teams, James has
						been moved to the MDMRT, Mohammad has been moved to the IDT,
						Joseph has swapped leader roles with Adrian, and Gurdeep has
						swapped leader roles with Hannah. The reason for this was that we
						believed that this would improve our work efficiency and because
						there was an imbalance of work delegation.</p>
					<p>We have had a play of the hack version of Peril and we have
						created a detailed plan of what we want to achieve for the MVP
						submission. We are now looking at including more maps, working on
						the display quality of them and refining the UI by including some
						menus.</p>

					<h1>Finalising the hack</h1>
					<p>We are ready to submit our Hack, there are just a few things
						left to figure out and we should be on our way. We are just
						ensuring that the map is clickable and responsive to how we
						imagined it. IDT has created a clickable and viewable map, with
						basic functionality which was able to meet the Hack’s
						requirements.</p>
					<p>The project plan is coming along nicely 98% finished, there
						are just a few tweaks that need to be made to ensure the flow of
						the document is correct. We have decided to use a simplified UI
						for the hack submission.</p>
					<p>In terms of team structure, we are planning on some
						reshuffling. The leaders for WDMRT and UIDT will be changed,
						electing new team leaders. Our next step is to book an appointment
						with the project critic, for some more detailed analysis of the UI
						and the game operation.</p>

					<h1>Hacking up a storm</h1>
					<p>The development process of our Hack submission is fully
						underway, alongside a project plan. The WDMRT have been conducting
						some research into existing UI’s for Risk so that our UIDT have an
						idea around how to design our very own UI.</p>
					<p>We have decided to keep the UI simple and have to separate
						regions so that we do not have to worry about button overlaying at
						this instance. All the UML designs have been completed.</p>

					<h1>Down to business</h1>
					<p>This was the beginning of the designing process for the Hack
						milestone. During this week the development teams have discussed
						and devised some UML diagrams which would be used to implement the
						hack version of the game.</p>
					<p>We also discussed the scope for the Hack submission and we
						decided to keep the game as basic as possible for the time being:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>No menus</li>
						<li>Core gameplay loop</li>
						<li>Map display</li>
						<li>Players able to own continents and countries</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We shall keep you all updated on the progress of our
						project.</p>

					<h1>Getting organised</h1>
					<p>At the beginning of the week, every member of the group has
						downloaded the latest version of eclipse and imported the project
						via GitHub. Every member was given their own branch to implement.
						Joshua explained the code he had written to the rest of the group
						via screen share. This included the skeleton classes and initial
						implementation of the environmental hazard class. Initially, every
						member was given a class to work on.</p>
					<p>After an insightful meeting with the project mentor, the
						group has decided to split up into more manageable sub-teams.</p>
					<p>We decided on three</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Internal Development Team (IDT)
							<ul>
								<li>Josh</li>
								<li>Ezekiel</li>
								<li>James</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>User Interface Development Team (UIDT)
							<ul>
								<li>Adrian</li>
								<li>Joseph</li>
								<li>Nikita</li>
								<li>Mohammad</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Website Development, Market Research and Reporting Team
							(WDMRT)
							<ul>
								<li>Hannah</li>
								<li>Gurdeep</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This allows for better workflow, as work can be sent down
						from the group leader to the sub-team leaders and so on. This
						means that work can be closely monitored and of better quality.
						Now we have a more structured team, where every member knows what
						exactly they are responsible for during the project.</p>
					<p>We decided to use Slick2D and LWJGL as the libraries to use
						for the implementation of the game and Slack/Google Docs for file
						sharing, as we can have control over what needs to be done and it
						allows for easy access to any documents needed for production.
						GitHub issues will be used for task delegation.</p>

					<h1>Project Launch</h1>
					<p>Hello, people of the world! We are the Strategic Goats aka
						Team 5 of CS2010. This is our very first blog post in which we
						introduce to our virtual board game! We spent this week discussing
						which board game to create and to start planning and recording the
						pitch which was to be due in week two.</p>
					<p>Our two main options of board games were Chess and Risk,
						however, the vote among all group members ended in 50/50, so in
						order to decide the final outcome, we have flipped a coin and Risk
						was the result of this. After deciding upon Risk, we brainstormed
						what our game will be like and how we will propose this on the
						pitch.</p>
					<p>Tun, Tun Tuunnn! So, without further ado we introduce to you
						*ominous music* Peril!!</p>
					<p>Peril is a virtual turn based strategy game based on the
						board game Risk. Users of the game take it in turns to place
						troops in various areas of the map, they then attack their
						counter-parts in attempt to acquire that area, if successful the
						area attacked becomes theirs and the final step is to reassemble
						your troops and make your acquired areas stronger if needed. The
						winner is the person with the most territories on the map. Battles
						are won and decided by random dice rolls completed by the game.</p>
					<p>What is more the game is made more difficult with the
						addition of environmental hazards which randomly occur across the
						map, if hit with one of these hazards users’ armies can be
						minimized without even battling.</p>
					<p>So that ladies and gents is Peril, we will keep you posted
						through further blog posts with updates on how the project is
						going and where you can get Peril etc.</p>
					<p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more!</p>
