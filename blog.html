		<h1>#7 - AI Tournament</h1>
		<p>Good afternoon! The AI tournament is at an end and our last
			touches are being made for the final release of Peril on the 19th of
			this month!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Knight beat Ernie 2-0</li>
			<li>Noob beat Ocelot 2-0</li>
			<li>Knight beat Noob 2-0</li>
			<li>Knight beat Final Boss 2-1</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Duckling and Goat were not used in the tournament as they were
			not functional, therefore had no useful interactions in the game.</p>
		<h3>Upcoming updates:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>New, detailed instructions written in full to help players
				which are new to Peril.</li>
			<li>Easy, Medium and Hard AI’s</li>
			<li>Improved credits page for better readability</li>
			<li>A fancy pre-game load screen splash displaying ‘Strategic
				Goats</li>
			<li>A new, better looking map</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Hope everyone is looking forward to the final release of Peril
			on 19/03/18 as much as we are. Remember to update your version of
			Peril to get a grip of the new updates!</p>

		<h1>#6 - Newest Additions</h1>
		<p>Good evening, tomorrow we will be releasing some new additions.
			Here is a summary of what changes you can expect:</p>
		<p>
		<h3>
			1. Mini-Map: <br>
		</h3>
		A useful, visual aid to help players locate their enemies! This will
		be a simplified view of the entire map to make the game more user
		friendly.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>
			2. UI:<br>
		</h3>
		User-interface is being finalised. Some tweaks and bug fixes have been
		made! Unscaled images are now in the process of being fixed and will
		try and accommodate screen resolutions of 2k and above in future
		updates. The feedback from UI surveys will implement the changes you
		have requested, keep in touch for when these changes drop!
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>
			3. AI: <br>
		</h3>
		The group members’ implementation for the AI tournament should be in
		its final stages tomorrow, meaning the best and most complex AI will
		win a prize next Thursday! Pro Peril players will now be tested on
		their skill to beat this new, challenging AI bot, along with a variety
		of other AI’s at difficulty levels.

		<h1>#5 - The state of Peril</h1>
		<p>Hello everyone</p>
		<p>Project Lead (Joshua) here to talk about where Peril is in
			terms of final release and the open beta.</p>
		<p>Usually, James from WDMRT collects all the information from the
			separate groups to curates this post but today we felt that the
			information would be best coming from the head honcho.</p>
		<p>We are working diligently to prepare the game for final release
			and our development team (myself included) are adding fun new
			features that we hope will provide complexity and new strategic
			avenues for players.</p>
		<p>Our design/gameplay balance philosophy is “the smarter player
			should win”. However, we still want the game to be interesting to
			play even when there is an experience disparity.</p>
		<p>
			We have introduced a point based economy:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Points can be spent on upgrading countries and units.</li>
			<li>Points are rewarded for killing units, taking countries and
				completing challenges.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The beta test will begin 01/03/18 and last for two weeks.
			During this period players will be able to download the beta version
			of Peril and submit feedback via a link packaged with the game.</p>
		<p>We hope that their feedback will be in depth and give us
			meaningful insight into the small tweaks to be made for the final
			release.</p>
		<p>Our final release of the game is slated for 19/03/18.</p>
		<p>
			See you then<br> Joshua
		</p>

			limited difficulty settings with our AI?</p>
		<p>We are currently working on creating multiple AI’s with
			different play styles! We are holding a tournament to see who can
			create the best and most complex AI. Keep in touch to follow our new
			additions!</p>

		<h1>#2 - What features does our MVP have?</h1>

		<h2>We are back with a functional game which perfectly portrays
			how it should work! We are now working on improving the user
			interface, but for now, these are Peril's current features:</h2>
		<p>1. Finely tuned setup menu allowing you to distribute your
			armies in equal quantities either randomly or specifically placed on
			the board.</p>
		<p>2. Working reinforcement state allowing players to distribute
			units according to the round number and the players’ owned countries.</p>
		<p>3. Pause menu: allowing the user to see it's current challenges
			he/she could work towards completing, saving game states in multiple
			save slots which can be loaded from the main menu and allowing to
			toggle music on and off.</p>
		<p>4. Working combat phase allowing players to attack other
			players’ countries. Higher the army size of the attacker, results in
			a higher chance of a successful invasion. Each unit represents a dice
			roll which ultimately means using more units results in a higher
			value dice roll.</p>
		<p>5. New help menu, explaining the rules of the game itself and
			the application denoted by a ‘?’ symbol.</p>
		<p>6. An operative movement state, allowing the user to transfer
			units from one country to another. Troops can be moved between
			non-neighbouring countries if there is a chain, connecting friendly
			countries. This can be seen by a path finding feature also
			implemented into the game.</p>
		<p>7. An good looking victory screen showing the rankings of
			players in order of when they were knocked out of the game.</p>
		<p>8. Environmental hazards which could occur randomly after each
			state, possibly reducing army sizes depending on the hazard.</p>
		<p>9. An impressive new map representing ‘Tamriel’ from the
			popular video game ‘The Elder Scrolls’.</p>
		<p>10. Simple AI player you can play against or watch.</p>
		<p>Keep in tune with our blog posts for detailed updates and
			information about our progress. Happy domination!</p>

		<h1>#1 - Project Launch</h1>
		<p>Hello people of the world! We are the Strategic Goats aka Team
			5 of CS2010. This is our very first blog post in which we introduce
			to you our virtual board game! Tun, Tun Tuunnn! So, without further
			ado we introduce to you *ominous music* Peril!!</p>
		<p>Peril is a virtual turn based strategy game based on the board
			game Risk. Users of the game take it in turns to place troops in
			various areas of the map, they then attack their counter-parts in
			attempt to acquire that area, if successful the area attacked becomes
			theirs and the final step is to reassemble your troops and make your
			acquired areas stronger if needed. The winner is the person with the
			most territories on the map. Battles are won and decided by random
			dice rolls completed by the game. What is more the game is made more
			difficult with the addition of environmental hazards which randomly
			occur across the map, if hit with one of these hazards users’ armies
			can be minimized without even battling. So that ladies and gents is
			Peril, we will keep you posted through further blog posts with
			updates with how the project is going and where you can get Peril
			etc.</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more!</p>
