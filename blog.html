				<p>Good morning people of the world! We are the Strategic Goats aka Team 5 of CS2010. 
				This is our very first blog post in which we introduce to you our virtual board game! 
				Tun, Tun Tuunnn! 
				So, without further ado we introduce to you *ominous music* Peril!! </p>
				<p>Peril is a virtual turn based strategy game based on the board game Risk. Users of the 
				game take it in turns to place troops in various areas of the map, they then attack their counter-parts in attempt to acquire that area, if successful the area attacked becomes theirs and the final step is to reassemble your troops and make your acquired areas stronger if needed. The winner is the person with the most territories on the map. Battles are won and decided by random dice rolls completed by the game. What is more the game is made more difficult with the addition of environmental hazards which randomly occur across the map, if hit with one of these hazards users’ armies can be minimized without even battling. 
				So that ladies and gents is Peril, we will keep you posted through further blog posts with 
				updates with how the project is going and where you can get Peril etc.</p> 
				<p>Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more!</p>

			<h1> #1 - What features does our MVP have? </h1>
			
						<h2>We are back with a functional game which perfectly portrays how it should work! We are now
			working on improving the user interface, but for now, these are Peril's current features:</h2>
			<p>1. Finely tuned setup menu allowing you to distribute your armies in equal quantities either randomly or specifically placed on the board.</p>
			<p>2. Working reinforcement state allowing players to distribute units according to the round number and the players’ owned countries.</p>
			<p>3. Pause menu: allowing the user to see it's current challenges he/she could work towards completing, saving game states in multiple save
			slots which can be loaded from the main menu and allowing to toggle music on and off.</p>
			<p>4. Working combat phase allowing players to attack other players’ countries. Higher the army size of the attacker, results in a 
			higher chance of a successful invasion. Each unit represents a dice roll which ultimately means using more units results in a higher 
			value dice roll.</p>
			<p>5. New help menu, explaining the rules of the game itself and the application denoted by a ‘?’ symbol.</p>
			<p>6. An operative movement state, allowing the user to transfer units from one country to another. Troops can be moved between 
			non-neighbouring countries if there is a chain, connecting friendly countries. This can be seen by a path finding feature also implemented
			into the game.</p>
			<p>7. An good looking victory screen showing the rankings of players in order of when they were knocked out of the game.</p>
			<p>8. Environmental hazards which could occur randomly after each state, possibly reducing army sizes depending on the hazard.</p>
			<p>9. An impressive new map representing ‘Tamriel’ from the popular video game ‘The Elder Scrolls’.</p>
			<p>10. Simple AI player you can play against or watch.</p>
			<p>Keep in tune with our blog posts for detailed updates and information about our progress. Happy
			domination!</p>
